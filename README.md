Description:  In this pandemic, people have not been able to celebrate their achievements and 
accomplishments with their friends and family. One of those achieve-ments is the convocation/graduation 
ceremony of the students who have successfully invested their hard-work and dedication for achieving this 
pres-tigious milestone. A physical graduation ceremony restricts the number of people who can be invited. 
Limited hall capacity, limited seating and catering don’t allow students to invite all those they would 
like to join in on their spe-cial day. A virtual convocation ceremony allows students to invite as many 
family members as they would like. Their family could be in any part of the world, but they wouldn’t miss this 
special day. Live broadcasting to remote audiences and on-demand post-event sessions truly ensures no one is 
left behind, be it students, parents or their families and friends. At times, students go back to their home 
country and are unable to come back for their gradua-tion ceremonies. This also helps them attend and make memories 
with their friends, batchmates and family. This is where the project idea comes into play, where a cross platform 
app will be made that will be able to provide a real life environment to the students and their family members where 
they will be able to enjoy the convocation ceremony without breaking any social distancing norms.
